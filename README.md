# Neural Nets
This is a collection of various types of neural networks built from scratch with NumPy and used for various classification and regression problems. It includes a basic feed-forward neural network, a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The feed-forward neural network is used to classify the species of an Iris flower using the Iris dataset and whether a particle collision resulted in a Higgs boson using the Higgs dataset. The RNN is used to used to predict the next timestep of a sinusoidal function given a randomly shifted sinewave. The CNN is used to classify simple RGB images.
